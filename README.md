## Summify-Document-Summarizer - Gemini LLM


This project implements Google's Gemini LLM to automatically generate concise summaries of large PDF documents. The goal is to provide an efficient way to extract key insights from lengthy files, making it ideal for research, professional reports, and legal documents.


## Features

  1) Utilizes Gemini LLM API: Harnesses Google's powerful large language model with an extended context window to process and summarize large texts.

2) Supports large documents: The model is capable of handling up to 1 million tokens, allowing it to summarize extensive content such as books, research papers, and long legal documents.

3) Multimodel capabilities: Although focused on PDFs for this implementation, Gemini is also optimized for handling various other data types like text, video, and code.

4) In-context learning: The model adapts to new tasks with in-context examples, without needing further training.
